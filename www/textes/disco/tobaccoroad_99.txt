I was born in a dump
Cm    Bb       Cm        Bb
Mamma died and daddy got drunk
Cm           Bb Cm     Bb
Left me here to die or grow
Cm                                   Bb
In the middle of Tobacco Road, wo wo wo

Grew up in a rusty shack
All I had was hangin' on my back
Only you know how I loathe
Cm                                         F7
This place called Tobacco Road, but it's home

                        C7
The only life I've ever known
                    F7     Bb F7 Bb F7 Bb F7 Bb F7
Only you know how I loathe
        Cm   Bb Cm Bb Cm Bb Cm Bb
Tobacco Road

Gonna leave get a job
With the help and the grace from above
Save some money get rich I know
Bring it back to Tobacco Road, wo wo wo

Bring dynamite and a crane
Blow it up start all over again
Build a town be proud to show
Give the name Tobacco Road, but it's home

                          F7 Bb  F7 Bb F7 Bb
I despise you 'cos you're filthy
F7  Bb     F7              Cm   Ab7 Cm Bb Cm Bb Cm Bb
But I love you 'cos you're home
